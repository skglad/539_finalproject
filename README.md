# SI539 Final Project

by Sara Gladchun

### Objective: 
To create a better user experience and front-end development of a previous Python project in order to have a portfolio piece that demonstrates my back-end and front-end development skills.

### Note:
GitHub pages does not support code other than html so I cannot host this page on GitHub pages and the code needs to be run through locally through terminal at the moment. This can be done by cloning or downloading the repo from GitHub and by running the book_toolsv2.py file in the terminal (in the proper folder). It is important to keep the folder structure the same as it is in the GitHub repo. As a next step, I would like to deploy this using AWS or something similar. 

### Repo for original Project: 
https://github.com/skglad/SI507_Final_Project

### Included in this github repo:
- backend Python code for flask application
- static folder with images, css, and javascript files
- template folder with updated templates to include html and css
- original template folder for reference (old html files with minimal html)
- other docs folder with PDF of presentation for class discussion and PDF of project outline and time documentation
- accessbility screenshots with screenshots of wave validation
- database file (program will create this if it's not included)
- books csv from goodreads (previously cleaned and formatted)
